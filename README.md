# honours_project
The code from Jordan Pag√©'s honours project.

These were written between September and Decemeber 2021.

deatailedBalance_V.py: This file finds the optimal mu_CV for a spceified Eg 
and plots the efficiency and the JV curve vs mu_CV for the specified eG.

deatailedBalance_eG&V_plotV.py: this file finds the optimal mu_CV and Eg for 
given starting parameters and plots the JV and efficiency curves vs mu_CV.

deatailedBalance_eG&V_plot_eG.py: this file finds the optimal mu_CV and Eg for 
given starting parameters and plots the efficiency curve vs Eg.

In the future, deatailedBalance_eG&V_plot_eG.py and 
deatailedBalance_eG&V_plotV.py will be combined into a single file.
