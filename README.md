# honours_project
The code from Jordan Pag√©'s honours project.


The following files were written between September and Decemeber 2021:

  deatailedBalance_V.py: 
  This file finds the optimal mu_CV for a spceified Eg and plots the 
  efficiency and the JV curve vs mu_CV for the specified eG.

  deatailedBalance_eG&V_plotV.py: 
  this file finds the optimal mu_CV and Eg for given starting parameters 
  and plots the JV and efficiency curves vs mu_CV.

  deatailedBalance_eG&V_plot_eG.py: 
  this file finds the optimal mu_CV and Eg for given starting parameters 
  and plots the efficiency curve vs Eg.


The following files were written between January and April 2022:

  detailed_balance_IBSC.py: 
  This file prompts the user wether to find the efficiency limit of an 
  IBSC device (Luque & Marti 1997), recreate figure 2 from the Luque & 
  Marti 1997 paper, or do both. Each option takes ~10 minutes to run with 
  current settings.

  find_alpha_eff.py: 
  this file imports the solar spectrum data and the data on the index 
  of refraction of AlGaAs (all of which is located in folder
  'absorption&spectrum_data'. There are other options of materials to use in 
  the folder.). This file uses the complex part k of the index of refraction 
  to calculate the absorption coefficient vs wavelength of the material. It 
  then calculates an effective absorption coefficient for the portion of the 
  solar spectrum above the minimum energy needed for a transition in that
  material (this energy level is given by the user).

  plot_band_diagram.py: 
  this file imports data output from a Simudo simulation and plots the band
  digram of the device.

  plot_JV.py: 
  this file imports data output from a Simudo simulation and plots the 
  JV-curve of the device.
  
  heatmap.py:
  This file optimises mu_CV and mu_CI for a given pair of e_G and e_I to create 
  a 2D heatmap of efficiencies. Runs in about 5 minutes and creates a 10x10 heatmap 
  with current settings.

  example_output
  This folder contains an example of what is output from Simudo. The data in the 
  folder is called by plot_JV.py and plt_band_diagram.py.
  
  absorptions&spectrum_data:
  This folder contains the data on the real and imaginary parts of the materials 
  used in the Ahsan et al. 2012 paper. It also has data on the solar spectrum, on 
  AM0, AM1.5D and AM1.5G.
